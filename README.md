## Introduction

Welcome to Project Web 3.0 Exercise, a web project that uses modern web technologies to create a responsive user interface. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The CSS styling for this project is designed to be clean and easy to read. The base font used is 'Inter', a versatile sans-serif typeface. The base color for the text is `#C5C6CE`, a light, neutral gray that provides good contrast against various background colors.
